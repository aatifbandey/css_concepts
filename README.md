Concept on Static | Relative | Absolute | Fixed

	Static
	Static is default position of every element in css.
	Z-index wont work for it


	Relative
	It is the most confused position. As it means its relative to itself
	Eg if you give postion:relative to a div and also provide left : 10px it will move 10 px
	from where it was.Also z-index works for this

	Absolute
	This position is dependent on its parent if you give top:10px and its parent is relative then it will move
	10px from parent div z-index works for this

	Fixed:
	This position is relative to viewport 

Difference b/w 
	
	@media (max-width:632px) vs @media screen and (max-width:632px) vs @media only screen and (max-width:632px)
	
	@media (max-width:632px)
	This one is saying for a window with a max-width of 632px that you want to apply these style and lesser width than 632px 

	@media screen and (max-width:632px)
	This one is saying for a device with a screen and a window with max-width of 632px apply the style. The difference is media type should be screen not print or other media type

	@media only screen and (max-width:632px)
	The keyword ‘only’ can also be used to hide style sheets from older user agents. User agents must process media queries starting with ‘only’ as if the ‘only’ keyword was not present

Specificity 
	inline sytyle
	ID - 100
	Class
	Attributes
	Sudeo class

Semantic HTMl
	it represents the content of web page.
	Eg <h1> to <h6> are semantic tags
		<p> is a semantic tag
		<code>, <abbr>, <span> etc are semantic tags

	Memorize how to measure specificity. “Start at 0, add 1000 for style attribute, add 100 for each ID, add 10 for each attribute, class or pseudo-class, add 1 for each element name or pseudo-element. So in
	body #content .data img:hover
	the specificity value would be 122 (0,1,2,2 or 0122): 100 for #content, 10 for .data, 10 for :hover, 1 for body and 1 for img.” [CSS Specificity]

	Important table for order specificity

	1	* { }	0
	2	li { }	1 (one element)
	3	li:first-line { }	2 (one element, one pseudo-element)
	4	ul li { }	2 (two elements)
	5	ul ol+li { }	3 (three elements)
	6	h1 + *[rel=up] { }	11 (one attribute, one element)
	7	ul ol li.red { }	13 (one class, three elements)
	8	li.red.level { }	21 (two classes, one element)
	9	style=””	1000 (one inline styling)
	10	p { }	1 (one HTML selector)
	11	div p { }	2 (two HTML selectors)
	12	.sith	10 (one class selector)
	13	div p.sith { }	12 (two HTML selectors and a class selector)
	14	#sith	100 (one id selector)
	15	body #darkside .sith p { }	112 (HTML selector, id selector, class selector, HTML selector; 1+100+10+1)

	Why it is important ?

	Many visually impaired people rely on speech browsers to read pages back to them. These programs cannot interpret pages very well unless they are clearly explained.

	Search engines need to understand what your content is about in order to rank you properly on search engines. Semantic code tends to improve your placement on search engines

	Semantic code makes site updates easier because you can apply design style to headings across an entire site instead of on a per page basis.
